# visidata_hpc

This provides an easy-to-bootstrap instance of the [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) package,
for use on
[USYD's hpc cluster](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/training/coursedocs/Introduction_to_HPC.pdf). 

My dotbot repo https://github.com/mstr3336/dotfiles will bootstrap this using the "hpc" profile.
